# Products Recommendations Evaluation

## Case: Evaluating an AI System for an E-commerce Product Recommendation System

**Issue:** An e-commerce platform wants to deploy an AI system to provide personalized product recommendations to its customers. The platform has noticed that customers often have difficulty finding products they are interested in, which can lead to decreased sales and customer satisfaction. The company wants to implement an AI system that can recommend products that are likely to be of interest to individual customers, based on their browsing history, purchase history, and other relevant information.

**Information Used:** The AI system will analyze customer data, including browsing history, purchase history, search queries, and product category preferences. The system will also use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in customer behavior and recommend products that are likely to be of interest.

**Methodology: ** The AI system will be evaluated using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to ensure that it can provide accurate and relevant product recommendations to customers.

1.	Data Collection and Preparation: The first step in evaluating the AI system will be to collect a large sample of customer data, including browsing history, purchase history, and demographic information. The data will be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any irrelevant or duplicate information.

2.	Performance Metrics: To evaluate the performance of the AI system, we will use the following metrics:
- Click-Through Rate (CTR): The percentage of recommended products that the customer clicks on.
- Conversion Rate (CR): The percentage of recommended products that the customer purchases.
- Average Order Value (AOV): The average value of products purchased by the customer.
  
3.	Testing Scenarios: To test the AI system's ability to provide accurate and relevant recommendations, we will use the following scenarios:
- A/B Testing: We will randomly assign customers to either the AI system or a baseline system that provides generic product recommendations. We will compare the performance of the AI system to the baseline system on metrics such as CTR, CR, and AOV.
- Cold Start Testing: We will evaluate the AI system's ability to provide relevant recommendations to new customers who have not yet provided any browsing or purchase history.
- Long-Term Testing: We will evaluate the AI system's ability to adapt to changes in customer preferences over time, by tracking customer behavior and purchases over several months.

4.	User Feedback: To supplement the quantitative metrics, we will also collect customer feedback on the recommendations provided by the AI system. We will ask customers to rate the relevance and usefulness of the recommendations and to provide suggestions for improvement.


**Conclusion:** By using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, we can ensure that the AI system can provide accurate and relevant product recommendations to customers. This will help the e-commerce platform increase sales and customer satisfaction, as well as provide a better user experience. The user feedback will also help the company understand customer preferences and improve the AI system's performance over time.
